<h1>Personal Leave</h1>
    <p>Whilst working at Western Cape Labs is awesome, we understand that some slackers like to not work at times ;) Below are some guidelines for full-time employees - part time employees will be handled individually.</p>

<h2>Leave structure</h2>
    <p>Every month, you get 1.5 days leave, essentially 18 days per year.</p>
    <p>The leave cycle runs from 1 March to end of February the next year. At the start of this cycle, you get 2 additional days, bringing the total leave days to 20 days per year.</p>
    <p>You can carry a maximum of 5 days forward into the next year's cycle if you didn't take all your leave for one cycle. Additional leftover leave will be forfeited, not paid out, so make sure to use your leave!</p>

<h2>Leave system</h2>
    <p>We currently don't have a great way of keeping track of leave days. This will hopefully be developed soon! Possibly a pull-request system?</p>
    <p>If you're taking more than a day's leave, make sure you ask Mike for it early enough that he can plan for your absence.</p>
