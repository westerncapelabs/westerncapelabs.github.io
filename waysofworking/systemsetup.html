    <h1>System Setup</h1>

        <p>You have to run Linux or OSX when working at Western Cape Labs. If you run Linux, we highly recommend that you use a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu or Linux Mint - you're on your own if you use something else.</p>

    <h2>Useful Software</h2>

        <p>Below are really useful things to install on a new system with some basic Linux installation instructions. As installation procedures change over time you might have to do something a bit differently. Generally the easiest way to install things is from the OS available packages, with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install thepackageyouwanttoinstall  // linux
brew install thepackageyouwanttoinstall  // mac
</code></pre>

        <p>But you should probably read the latest install instructions online before doing any installation. If you do an installation and see any warning messages, stop and ASK!</p>

    <h3>Git</h3>

        <p>We use Git for software version control of all our projects. Github stores our code remotely. If you don't have a Github account, go make one now! If you have one already, make sure your email addresses are setup correctly - including adding your @westerncapelabs.com email address. Then do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git
git config --global user.name yourgithubusername
git config --global user.email youremail
</code></pre>

        <p>You can read up on setting up SSH Authentication, but to get started quickly you can just use HTTPS Authentication. However, to prevent having to enter your username and password every time, use a credential helper to set how often you get password-prompted to every 24 hours (86400 seconds)</p>

<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'
</code></pre>

    <h3>Git Flow</h3>

        <p>Git flow is integral to the way we work. Try the following installation:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git-flow
// edit ~/.gitconfig to keep remote branches
git config --global gitflow.feature.finish.keepremote true
</code></pre>

    <h3>Hub</h3>

        <p>Hub allows for issue to pull-request conversion. Don't worry if you don't know what that means. Just try to install it</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/github/hub.git
cd hub
script/build
mv ./hub /usr/local/bin  # move to somewhere in your PATH
</code></pre>

    <h3>Text Editor</h3>

        <p>Our two favourite editors are <strong>Sublime Text 3</strong> and <strong>Atom</strong>. Sublime Text is loved by just about everyone who has used it, but it 'kind of' costs $70, while Atom is free and is practically a clone of Sublime Text. Sublime Text 'kind of' costs $70 because you can try it for free forever, you just have to ignore a pop-up 'buy me!' message every now and then. Or convince Mike to buy it for you :) If you haven't been using Sublime Text yet, Atom is probably your better bet.</p>
        <p>All that being said, feel free to use another editor if you prefer. But you should install something good (Nano won't cut it!)</p>

    <h3>Python</h3>

        <p>Python is currently being used in two major versions: v2.x and v3.x. Mostly the differences don't really affect us, nowadays we tend to use v3.x on new projects.</p>

        <p>Python may or may not be installed on your system, but that doesn't really matter, as you should be using <em>pyenv</em>! pyenv manages your Python versions, and with the extention <em>pyenv-virtualenv</em>, it also manages your virtual environments. More on virtual environments later. Install may happen like this:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv.git ~/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
</code></pre>

    <h3>Pip</h3>

        <p>Pip is Python's package (library) installer/manager. You will use this all the time.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-pip
</code></pre>

    <h3>Chrome</h3>

        <p>While you should feel free to use any browser, we mostly use Chrome. We use the Chrome app Postman a lot, not sure if that's available in Firefox. If not just install Chrome. Chrome may ask you to add a repository to your OS - it's okay to do so.</p>

    <h3>Other things you may need to install</h3>

        <h4>curl</h4>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install curl
</code></pre>
