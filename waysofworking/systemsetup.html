    <h1>System Setup</h1>

        <p>You have to run Linux or OSX when working at Western Cape Labs. If you run Linux, we highly recommend that you use a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu or Linux Mint - you're on your own if you use something else.</p>

    <h2>Useful Software</h2>

        <p>Below are really useful things to install on a new system with some basic Linux installation instructions. As installation procedures change over time you might have to do something a bit differently.</p>

    <h3>Git</h3>

        <p>We use Git for software version control of all our projects. Github stores our code remotely. If you don't have a Github account, go make one now! If you have one already, make sure your email addresses are setup correctly - including adding your @westerncapelabs.com email address. Then do:</p>

            <code>
                sudo apt-get install git<br>
                git config --global user.name _yourgithubusername_<br>
                git config --global user.email _youremail_
            </code>

        <p>You can read up on setting up SSH Authentication, but to get started quickly you can just use HTTPS Authentication. However, to prevent having to enter your username and password every time, use a credential helper to set how often you get password-prompted to every 24 hours (86400 seconds)</p>

            <code>
                git config --global credential.helper cache<br>
                git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'
            </code>

    <h3>Text Editor</h3>

        <p>Our two favourite editors are <strong>Sublime Text 3</strong> and <strong>Atom</strong>. Sublime Text is loved by just about everyone who has used it, but it kind of costs $70, while Atom is free and is practically a clone of Sublime Text. Sublime Text kind of costs $70 because you can try it for free forever, you just have to ignore a pop-up 'buy me!' message every now and then. Or convince Mike to buy it for you :)</p>

    <h3>Python</h3>
